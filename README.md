# FileManagerODBC

Restored the repository after finding that there are people using the code. 

Anyway, if you are using the code, please help with the following.

1.  Add an issue for any errors.
2.  Add an issue for any requests, features, ...


Future updates, 
I don't mind adding to the code if it is being used.

These are what I will add next, not in any order and no specific time lines.

Add additional data types for the BCP process.

Add support for ODBC Bulk Operations (Insert, Edit and Delete).  
Insert with Bulk Operations is not a fast as BCP, but does allow the three actions. 

Derived Browse Class and/or View Manager for use in typical Clarion browse screens.
